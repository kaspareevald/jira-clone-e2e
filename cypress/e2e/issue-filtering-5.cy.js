/**
 * Workshop #16
 * We are locating issues here based on one enter ('multiple assignees')
 * Think and create a loop using "forEach", which would allow us to test multiple enters without creating a new instance of test for that
 * Use object with multiple rows for solving this task.
 *
 * Expected result:
 * 1. You will have object with multiple entries
 * 2. You are running test X amount of times without creating new instance of test (using "it")
